# Reciprocal-RELION-3D-Classification-Analysis
This repository provides a Python CLI tool for reciprocal analysis of RELION 3D classification jobs. It automates particle splitting, cross-job class comparison, intersection analysis, and generation of RELION-readable STAR files for class intersections (for the last one, you may still need to manually add optics table)
